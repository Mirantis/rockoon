# What is Rockoon

Rockoon is Kubernetes controller that provides Life Cycle Management for OpenStack services.

[OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org/) is a free, open standard cloud computing platform.
It is mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) in both public and private clouds
where virtual servers and other resources are made available to users. The software platform
consists of interrelated components that control diverse, multi-vendor hardware pools of
processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. Users manage it either
through a web-based dashboard, through command-line tools, or through RESTful web services.

Rockoon automates deployment and management of OpenStack to provide self-managing,
self-scaling and self-healing services.
